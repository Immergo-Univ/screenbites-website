                    Service Provider
                    <br>
                    The entity providing the Service is Screenbites (US) LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101, Dover, Delware 19904 (referred to as “Screenbites”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).

                    <strong>Applicable Terms</strong> 
                    <br>
                    You may access and use the Service as provided, if you comply with these terms, and our Privacy Policy (together, the "Agreement"), and applicable laws. Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand or do not accept any part of the Agreement, you may not use the Service.
                    <br> 
                    If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organization, you confirm to us that you have authority to act on behalf of that entity, and that entity accepts this Agreement.

                    <strong>Age Requirements</strong> 
                    <br>
                    You may use the Service if you are at least 13 years old; however, children of all ages may use the Service if enabled by a parent or legal guardian. If you are under 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Service. Please have them read this Agreement with you. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Permission by Parent or Guardian</strong> 
                    <br>
                    If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by allowing your child to use the Service, you agree to the terms of this Agreement and accept responsibility for your child’s use of the Service.
                    <br>

                    <strong>Access Restriction</strong> 
                    <br>
                    You are solely responsible for all use of and for protecting the confidentiality of any email verification process, registered password, and PIN code used by you in connection with the Service. Do not share these credentials with any third parties. While the Service enables the restoration of your credentials, it is advised to change them periodically.
                    <br>
                    Screenbites provides an extra layer of security to prevent child access without parental consent. However, it is your responsibility to manage your credentials and oversee restricted sections of the Service, such as in-app purchases. Please ensure that adequate parental controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access.

                    <br>

                    <strong>Reservation</strong>
                    <br>
                    Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of Screenbites or the respective rights holders. This means, for example, that using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Content you access (including any branding used on or displayed in the Service).

                    <strong>Service Changes</strong>
                    <br>
                    Screenbites is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new content or services, or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, to make performance or security improvements, comply with law, or prevent illegal activities or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users, or even an individual user.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Screenbites will occasionally require software updates for you to continue using the Service. Your acceptance of these updates is essential. If you do not install the updates, you will lose access to the Service and will be blocked until the latest update is installed. When the Service requires a software update, it may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Screenbites shall not be liable for any interruptions or failures in the functionality of the Service that may result from these changes. We strive to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth experience, but occasional disruptions may occur as we improve and update the Service.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Account Suspension and Termination</strong>
                    <br>
                    You may stop using the Service at any time and can delete the Service from your device. You can also choose to delete your account, which will remove your data without an option to recover it. Your data and purchases will be automatically deleted six months after your last login.                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Screenbites reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account or your access to all or part of the Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe that there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user, other third party, Screenbites or our Affiliates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by Screenbites unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, Screenbites or our Affiliates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If your account is blocked, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe that the termination or suspension has been made in error, you can appeal using the contact options in the Parent’s Room section of the Service.
